1) HTTP

* HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol
* It is used in client-server communication
* The user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user

HTTP 1.1

* It works on the textual format
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources
* It compresses data by itself

HTTP 2

* It works on the binary protocol
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
* It uses HPACK for data compression

2) Objects

* A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior
* Objects are the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript
* objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data of primitive or reference types 
in the form of “key: value” pairs
* These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively in the context of an object
* Syntax for object is var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
* Basic example : var myCar = new Object();
 myCar.make = 'Cars';
 myCar.model = 'Hyundai';
 myCar.year = 2024;
* Basic Program
